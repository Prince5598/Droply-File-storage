## 🧠 How It Works (Architecture)
- Clerk handles authentication and user sessions.

- Files/Folders are stored relationally using Drizzle ORM and Neon DB, supporting self-referencing folder structures.

- Uploads are sent to ImageKit with metadata saved in the database.

- Previews use direct URLs from ImageKit (for images, PDFs, etc.).

- Trash logic uses soft-trash flags (isTrashed), and emptying trash deletes records permanently.
